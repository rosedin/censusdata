# School Census Data
## Group Six-th Sense

### The original decision back in 2015 involved "flagging" unusual responses by creating a separate variable. We chose to stick with the same method, but changed the decisions that were made back in 2015 about the scoring of some of the variables.

### 0 = no problem/not altered 1 = slightly unusual 2 = extremely unusual (likely a problem)

## Reading in Census Data
library(readxl)
Census <- read_xlsx("CensusAtSchoolDatabase2018asof12-8-18.xlsx")

## Ageyears 
## ages 5 and younger and ages 23 and older were flagged as extremely unusual. Ages between 6 and 8 and ages between 20 and 22 were also flagged as slightly unusual.
Census$flag_age_years <- 0
Census$flag_age_years[which(Census$Age_years <= 5 | Census$Age_years >= 23)] <- 2
Census$flag_age_years[which(Census$Age_years >= 6  & Census$Age_years <= 8)] <- 1
Census$flag_age_years[which(Census$Age_years >= 20 & Census$Age_years <= 22)] <- 1


## ClassSize 
### A class size of more than 60 was flagged. Some states have laws prohibiting large class sizes in schools. After plotting the data a decision was made to make 60 the cut-off value. 
### We chose to use only "extremely unusual" as a flag in this case since most class sizes fall within a designated range due to school laws and funding. 
Census$flag_classsize <- 0
Census$flag_classsize[which(Census$ClassSize >= 60 | Census$ClassSize < 1)] <- 2


## Languages_spoken
### We categorized more than 15 languages as unlikely for school-aged children. Between 10 and 15 languages was also flagged.
Census$Languages_spoken[Census$Languages_spoken == 0] <-1
Census$flag_languages_spoken <- 0
Census$flag_languages_spoken[which(Census$Languages_spoken >15)] <- 2
Census$flag_languages_spoken[which(Census$Languages_spoken >=10 & Census$Languages_spoken <=15)] <- 1


##3Reaction_time 
### We kept reaction time the same.
Census$flag_reaction_time <- 0
Census$flag_reaction_time[which(Census$Reaction_time < 0.101)] <- 2
Census$flag_reaction_time[which(Census$Reaction_time >1.21)] <- 2


##3Travel_time_to_School
### We changed the travel times that would be flagged as 1, or "slightly unusual", to between 75 minutes and 120 minutes because in big cities with traffic and rural areas with lack of schools, travel times could feasibly be within this interval.

## Footlength_cm
### Based on research of footsizes for children between the ages of 8 and 20, we chose 20 centimeters as the minimum cut-off value and 34 centimeter as the maximum cut-off value. We kept the same conversion calculations as the previous group and replaced the cut-off values.
